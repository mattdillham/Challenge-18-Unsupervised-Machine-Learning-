# Challenge-18-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-
The first step in this challenge was the processing of data. First I loaded the cryptocurrency information from the provided CSV file. Then I loaded the data into a Pandas DataFrame. Next I removed all cryptocurrencies that were not trading, removed all cryptocurrencies that did not have a defined algorithm, removed the Trading column, removed all cryptocurrencies with at least one null value as well as ones without coins mined. Then I stored all the cryptocurrencies into a DataFrame. Then removed the CoinName column. After that i created dummies variables for the text features. Then I standardized the data. After that I reduced the data dimensions using PCA. After that I clustered the cryptocurrencies using K-means. Finally, I visualized all of the data with a 3D scatter plot, another scatter plot and a hvplot.table.
